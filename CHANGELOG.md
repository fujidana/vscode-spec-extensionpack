# Change Log

Previously (â‰¤ v1.4.0) this extension, `fujidana.vscode-spec`, directly supported both __spec__ command files and __spec__ log files.
Later in v2.0.0, it was split into two exntensions, `fujidana.spec-command` for __spec__ command files and `fujidana.spec-log` for __spec__ log files, and the original extension identifier, `fujidana.vscode-spec`, was reused for this extension pack.

Check [fujidana.vscode-spec-command CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/fujidana/vscode-spec-command/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the history when the `vscode-spec` was an independent extension.

The last version of the independent extension was v1.4.0.
Because the version number smaller than the previously published one is not allowed in the market place, this extension pack starts its version number from v2.0.0.
