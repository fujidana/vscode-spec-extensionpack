# __spec__ Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code

## Notice for previous version users

Previously (â‰¤ v1.4.0) this extension, `fujidana.vscode-spec`, directly supported both __spec__ command files and __spec__ log files.
Later in v2.0.0, it was split into two exntensions, `fujidana.spec-command` for __spec__ command files and `fujidana.spec-log` for __spec__ log files, and the original extension identifier, `fujidana.vscode-spec`, was reused for this extension pack.

A user who only needs language support for either file type can uninstall this extension pack and then install the independent one.

## What's __spec__?

> __spec__ is internationally recognized as the leading software for instrument control and data acquisition in X-ray diffraction experiments.
> It is used at more than 200 synchrotrons, industrial laboratories, universities and research facilities around the globe.
