# __spec__ Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code

## NOTICE for previous version users

Previously the language identifier of this extension pack, `vscode-spec`, was used by an independent extension that supports both __spec__ command files and __spec__ log files.
Later, for several reasons the developer decided to split this extension into two; one is for __spec__ command files (both the exention identifier and language identifier are `spec-command`) and the other is for __spec__ log files (`spec-log`).

The original extension identifier, `vscode-spec`, is reused for this extension pack so that previous users continue to get the latest language support for both file types without any manual installation process.

A user who only needs language support for either file type can uninstall this extension pack and then install the independent one.

## What's __spec__?

> __spec__ is internationally recognized as the leading software for instrument control and data acquisition in X-ray diffraction experiments.
> It is used at more than 200 synchrotrons, industrial laboratories, universities and research facilities around the globe.
