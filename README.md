# __spec__ Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code

## NOTICE for previous version users

Previously the language identifier of this extension pack, `vscode-spec`, was used to an extension that supports both __spec__ command files and __spec__ log files.
Later, for reasons to save the memory footprint in cases one of the file types is only used, the developer has decided to split this extension into two; one is for __spec__ command files (both the exention identifier and language identifier are `spec-command`) and the other is for __spec__ log file (`spec-log`).

The original language identifier, `vscode-spec` is reused as that of the extension pack that bundles the two extensions described above.

A user who only neads either extension can uninstall this pack and then install the independent one.

## What's __spec__?

> __spec__ is internationally recognized as the leading software for instrument control and data acquisition in X-ray diffraction experiments.
> It is used at more than 200 synchrotrons, industrial laboratories, universities and research facilities around the globe.
